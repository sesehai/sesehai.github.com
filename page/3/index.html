            <p>(Editor’s note: This is a guest post by Boriz Wertz, founder of Version One Ventures. The post went through PandoDaily’s usual editorial process. Mr. Wertz was not paid for this post.)</p>
<p>Three roles that every investor should play What’s the right role for an investor to play with their portfolio? Should he or she be the biggest cheerleader, the toughest critic, or just have the deepest pockets?</p>
<p>As someone who is still relatively early in his investing career, I often think about what qualities set a successful investor relationship apart from the rest. Good investing and strong relationships don’t just happen. Like in a marriage, you have to work every day on making the relationship better and more productive for all involved.</p>
<p>Having sat on both sides of the table, I believe the real magic happens when you can carefully balance three pillars: supporting, challenging, and coaching.</p>
<p>Pillar one: the steadfast supporter</p>
<p>The moment the contracts are signed, the investor essentially joins the team and assumes the role of an early evangelist. There will be times when portfolio teams need an enthusiastic backer and a quick pep talk. Particularly when things get tough, it’s nice to know that someone will weather the storm and stick by you.</p>
<p>I remember trying to build my start-up during technology’s nuclear winter of 2001. Raising fresh money was nearly impossible, but our investor supported us throughout this tough period and didn’t take advantage of our situation. We financed the company at acceptable terms, even though the investor could have really turned the screws. Ultimately, we were able to sell our company to AbeBooks, which was later sold to Amazon.</p>
<p>Tough times bring out the true colors of an investor. Do they treat you fairly or take advantage of your vulnerable position?</p>
<p>Pillar two: the critic</p>
<p>Most entrepreneurs are inherently optimistic, so the last thing they need is someone who will be a cheerleader 100% of the time. Honest, sometimes harsh, feedback is necessary. Calling out a lack of financial discipline, lack of accountability, or poor product roadmap is never the popular thing to do, but this is when an investor often adds the most value.</p>
<p>I was reminded of the importance of this role a few months ago when a portfolio company of mine had just raised a large amount of money and started to scale the cost base much quicker than the revenue base. Within months the burn rate more than doubled to several thousands of dollars a month and as the company got distracted with aggressive hiring, the growth rate decelerated significantly. Since high burn and low growth are a lethal combination, this situation would have gotten critical had they continued down their path. Fortunately, the founders took my pushback well and right-sized the ship quickly.</p>
<p>Investors need to be comfortable in the role of devil’s advocate, asking the hard questions and challenging the assumptions. Founders need to understand that constant praise without honesty are just empty words. You need the investor’s perspective: they are looking out for you.</p>
<p>Pillar three: the coach</p>
<p>I’m a firm believer in learning from other people’s successes and mistakes. Individuals who have been through it before can offer great insight to entrepreneurs – such as how to attract top talent, build a strong board, expand into new sectors, etc.</p>
<p>I am always on the lookout for opportunities where my portfolio teams can improve, and often connect founders with a CEO coach. In addition, I share my own experiences scaling a company with portfolio CEOs and senior management teams. Getting an outside perspective from somebody with a deep understanding of the company or industry can be very eye opening – it often helps you learn what you didn’t know before, and build stronger problem solving skills.</p>
<p>As for founders, they should solicit advice from a wide variety of sources, but always filter any feedback through the prism of their own convictions. After all, it’s the CEO, and not the investor, who should have the final word.</p>
<p>Final thoughts</p>
<p>While cash is crucial to scaling a company or getting a product off the ground, an investor can provide much more value than the checkbook alone. Investors need to be comfortable being the cheerleader one day, and offering the dissenting voice the next. Likewise, entrepreneurs should be open to receiving all feedback, no matter the message. As with any significant relationship, this one requires true effort on both sides to work.</p>

            <p>Apple had a pretty good quarter.</p>
<p>And by “pretty good,” I mean it was the biggest quarter in history. And not just for Apple. For any company. Ever.</p>
<p>This page charts the past record holders. Until today, Russia’s Gazprom (the largest natural gas extractor in the world) held the record at $16.2 billion in a quarter.</p>
<p>Apple now holds the record: $18.04 billion in profit, fiscal Q1 of 2015.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Insane.</p>
<p>For reference, that means Apple makes around $8.3 million dollars per hour in profit (24 hours a day).</p>
<p>Of the current Top 20 record holding earners, 15 are Oil/Gas producers — primarily ExxonMobil and Shell. The other five are all Apple, over various quarters.</p>

            <p>The Apple Watch will start shipping in April to consumers, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook, who revealed that month as the expected target launch date for the company on Apple’s Q1 2015 earnings call. The timeframe for launch was described as “early 2015″ when the Apple Watch was originally announced in September of last year.</p>
<p>The Apple Watch release date has been the subject of much speculation since its announcement, with recent reports pegging March as the month of its arrival. Cook’s decision to add some clarity to its actual release timeline is uncharacteristic for Apple, which normally doesn’t put a firm launch date on unreleased products, but pre-announcing the hardware months in advance was already a departure from standard practice.</p>
<p>Setting a more definite timeline for the Apple Watch does set expectations, however, ensuring that no one will be surprised when the wearable doesn’t appear in March as rumored. It also helps developers time their software releases correctly. Developers wanting to target the platform have so far depended upon using a virtual simulation of the wearable, and haven’t had any set deadline to work towards, so an announced April shipping target provides a clear goal to aim for.</p>
<p>Apple’s decision to pre-announce the Apple Watch was designed in part to get developers on board with the platform, so this helps set expectations in that regard. Its typical secrecy around product launches also isn’t necessary in this case, given that the Watch was pre-announced last year and expectations were already set for a general window.</p>
<p>“I’m using it every day, and love it, and I can’t live without it,” Cook said on the call, explaining his own excitement for the product. He also defended the April timeframe as within Apple’s defined “early 2014″ range in response to an analyst question which implied Apple may have wanted to deliver it earlier.</p>

            <p>Amazon has a new product called WorkMail debuting today (via Forbes), which is an email and calendaring service that aims to provide those tools for corporate customers. The tech is based on Amazon Web Services, and aims to best the reigning champs (which include Microsoft, and to a lesser extent, Google) in terms of ease of use and security.</p>
<p>The WorkMail product is compatible with existing client software like Outlook, and as such it could be easier to substitute for legacy Exchange email service offerings in place at many big corporate institutions provided by Microsoft. WorkMail is also encrypted once they’re sent, according to the Wall Street Journal, and then decrypted via a company-controlled key at the other end of the tunnel when received by the intended target. Emails are stored on Amazon servers located in geographic areas designed by its clients, marking another security feature that may be especially appealing to European customers post-NSA revelations.</p>
<p>Amazon’s pricing for WorkMail works out to about $4 per inbox, which is in line with the competition, but so far it doesn’t look like Amazon is offering up any additional features like access to the kinds of office document production software suites that Google and Microsoft offer.</p>
<p>AWS branching out to business that focuses more on the end-user and less on providing back-end solutions is interesting, but Amazon still seems to be positioning this as primarily a layer once removed from the person doing the actual email; it’s something to swap out for Exchange, leaving the interface software (Outlook on the desktop, or native mail clients on mobile) intact. WorkMail also offers a “feature-rich” web-based client for access without any special software.</p>
<p>Amazon intends to launch this in Q2 of 2015 at this point, and will also offer deals that incorporate its recently launched WorkDocs (formerly Zocalo) AWS-powered cloud-based enterprise storage. The $4 plan comes with a 50GB inbox limit, while just $2 extra per user per month will add a 200GB Zocalo file storage block on top of that. A preview is available now for those wanting to sign up for an early look.</p>
<p>The ambitions of AWS clearly go beyond the cloud computing back-end, and Amazon might view WorkMail as a way to gain more general recognition for its services line of business.</p>

            <p>Google has taken another step towards knowing everything about its users.</p>
<p>The company announced today that Google Now, the virtual assistant software that promises to provide information before a consumer even knows she needs it, will now be able to collect and present relevant data from some 40 third-party applications.</p>
<p>Here’s one example, from the blog post announcing the platform’s expansion, of how this ability to showcase information from other apps might work for consumers:</p>
<p>In the morning, catch up on news of the day with cards from The Guardian. On your commute, Pandora can give you recommendations for music to play, based on what you like, or you can be reminded to complete your daily French lesson on Duolingo. During your downtime, you can take care of the groceries, with a card from Instacart reminding you to stock up on the things you often order. If you’re planning a trip and looked up places to stay on your Airbnb app but couldn’t make up your mind, you’ll see Now cards from Airbnb for the location and dates you’ve researched. And when you land at an airport, you’ll see a card to order a Lyft.</p>
<p>This is supposed to be an exciting peek into a world where Google Now can know everything about you and make your life easier by unifying scores of applications in a virtual assistant that happens to have been made by a multi-tens-of-billion-dollar business built on selling consumers’ personal information to advertisers.</p>
<p>But the “new and improved” Google Now seems more like a nightmare scenario that makes it even harder to keep Google from learning all about its customers. It would know when they have woken up, when they’re driving, and when their flights land. It would know where they eat, what language they’re studying, and what music they like.</p>
<p>There’s a fair chance the company already knows much of this information. (How else are you going to find a language-learning app than by searching for it in Google? Or book a flight whose receipts are sent to Gmail? Or explore a city with anything besides Google Maps?) Yet this latest update is much more upfront about this fact, leaving no doubt about just how deeply into your life Google wishes to peer.</p>
<p>Google knows almost everything already, but it’s not satisfied with “almost.” For all the things it doesn’t know, it seems the plan is to partner with other companies to gather this information.  And, by saving consumers a few taps whenever they want to use their phones, Google will likely convince consumers it’s a trade-off worth making. After all, the main reason Google has survived (and thrived) this long is because it can make convenience trump privacy.</p>
<p>Now, if you’ll excuse me, Google Chrome just told me I’ve written too many words about how Google might be eroding consumer privacy. Luckily it’s playing this YouTube video to calm me down while it finds the weather forecast for the dank, dark dungeon Eric Schmidt built when he was still the company’s chief executive.</p>

            <p>Twitter is testing a new feature that creates an “instant timeline” for new users based on what those users’ friends (as collected from a smartphone’s contacts list) are already tweeting about.</p>
<p>The feature addresses a common complaint about Twitter: that it’s hard to know who to follow, which makes it harder for new users to suss out why they should even bother to use the service.</p>
<p>Now, instead of having to fumble about in search of accounts worth following, new users will get a better idea of why Twitter thinks it should join their list of must-visit social networks. A problem with which the embattled service has struggled for years might finally be solved.</p>
<p>The New York Times’ Vindu Goel said the feature managed to guess his interests fairly well, but he did complain that Twitter thought he might want to see tweets about sports, or from brands. (I was unable to test the new feature from myself when I tried to create a new account earlier.)</p>
<p>To which I would respond that Goel is basically complaining that the new “instant timelines” provide too accurate a view into what using Twitter will be like after the initial charm fades.</p>
<p>That’s when the sports tweets seem to dominate the service whenever there’s some kind of game, match, or other event; when the brands start to infiltrate users’ timeline with off-beat messages or promoted missives; and when the only thing anyone talks about is the media.</p>
<p>New users should know that going into the service. Half the time they’re going to watch as the media snarks out about the latest headlines. Another quarter of the time they’re going to see groan-worthy tweets from brands that should know better. The other quarter mixes the two.</p>
<p>People should know about this hell before Twitter manages to work its way into the lulls in a conversation, the lines at a grocery store, or the linoleum tiling of a bathroom floor. In that way it seems these new “instant timelines” are an honest feature.</p>
<p>Whether that’s going to be good for Twitter, which would probably prefer for its service to become something other than a vortex of “ironic” condescension and vitriol, is another story.</p>

            <p>When it comes to productivity applications, groups change everything. Tasks that are easy or merely annoying when two people are involved become a nightmare when the number of participants expands. This has led to hundreds of million or billion dollar valuations for companies that address the problem around messaging and collaboration. Los Angeles-based Klutch is aiming to bring the same kind of solution to scheduling.</p>
<p>Klutch has made a few key insights into the group scheduling process that it hopes will make the experience easier and more efficient for all involved. First, the app includes a full-featured messaging client aimed at avoiding the asynchronous back and forth of email and enabling plans to be developed in more real-time. Next, the app integrates with each user’s calendar to simplify determining shared availability. And lastly, the app integrates with discovery platforms to help recommend locations for meetings while also supporting virtual meetings via third-party audio and video conference calls.</p>
<p>“The big learning from [my previous company] Atlas to Klutch is the fact that all scheduling happens from natural conversation flow,” says Klutch founder and CEO Hunter Gray. “So we’ve given people the ability to have a WhatsApp plus Yelp plus iCal experience that starts from natural group chat.”</p>
<p>Plenty of companies have attempted to solve group scheduling before – think Boomerang Calendar – but none that I’ve encountered have combined the above functionality. In the future, Klutch’s plan is to incorporate AI to help make smarter recommendations based on contextual clues collected from group chat conversations and calendar data.</p>
<p>“We collect really powerful intent data because we’re capturing groups in the middle of organizing something during the ‘inner circle’ conversations where decisions are being made, not have been made,” Gray says. “So we can eventually give highly contextual suggestions and discounts based upon a group’s dynamics and intent, [which falls into] four levels: location, time and date, who’s involved, and the context.”</p>
<p>Klutch 2.0, the company’s first feature-complete version, has been available on iOS for approximately five months. Today the company is launching complementary Android and Web versions, rounding out its availability and addressing what has been the largest complaints of existing users. Klutch remains a mobile-first product, but with today’s update, it’s now possible for non-users to participate in scheduling chats and receive event invites via a temporary Web-link shared via email.</p>
<p>Klutch is in the very early days, with just 25,000 downloads and 10 percent of these users engaging with the app actively each month. The company has yet to spend on user acquisition, but has benefitted from being featured prominently in the iOS App Store’s Best New Apps section. Gray hopes that the platform expansion will help grow both adoption and engagement. Already, 60 percent of iOS users who are invited to Klutch have downloaded the app. With Android now available that viral loop should be a bit more effective as existing and new users create new groups.</p>
<p>One thing Klutch has going for it is the makeup of its founding team. In addition to his prior experience with Atlas, which itself was a group scheduling and productivity tool, Gray was previously a top-producing team leader within the direct sales industry, meaning he managed large groups of sales professionals. For Klutch, he recruited Lisa Dusseault, the co-author of the ubiquitous CalDAV protocol (among others), to be his co-founder. Collectively they know as much about both the needs of busy professionals and the technology available to address them as any team in the space. Together, Gray and Dusseault have raised $1.5 million for Klutch from investors including Knight &amp; Bishop, 37 Ventures, ACE Fund, and Launchpad LA.</p>
<p>“We’ve looked at the explosion of the messaging space and watched all these companies grow to billions of dollars in valuation,” Gray says. “It’s still shocking to me that no one’s created a product with that level of success in the calendaring and scheduling space. We want to be the productivity messenger.”</p>
<p>Gray is right that there are no calendaring unicorn. Some, like Sunrise, Tempo, and Fantastical, have earned critical acclaim and attracted meaningful VC investment. But none have truly broken out to the level that Whatsapp, Line, Yammer, Slack, and others have done in the messaging and collaboration space.</p>
<p>Most of the innovation in calendaring to date has focused on inward productivity, adding things like intelligent assistants and map and phone integration to make the individual user’s life easier. Klutch is focused on solving those issues that arise when calendaring is focused outward.</p>
<p>The downside for this new product is that group scheduling, while painful, is not an everyday problem. And for general-purpose calendaring, many of the above competitors offer more functionality and have largers active user bases. If Klutch is hoping to be its users’ everyday calendar app, it will need to be as good for these individual use-cases as it is when groups are concerned. In that regard, it has some work remaining. Gray and Dussealult seem to relish the challenge.</p>
<p>“With our platform expansion, there no longer a limitation on where and how our users and their friends, family, and co-workers can access Klutch,” Gray says. “The name Klutch comes from how we want people to feel when they use the product,” Gray says. “It’s like Tom Brady scoring on the final play to win a game. It’s a similar feeling when you finally get six people to agree to a place and time to meet.”</p>

            <p>Most of the things revealed at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona aren’t worth getting too excited about. For example, how many people are really going to be using any of the payment platforms introduced during the conference, or buying the expensive-but-“secure” devices, or paying even the slightest attention to talk about Google’s wireless network or Facebook’s drones?</p>
<p>But there is at least one thing worth paying attention to: Qualcomm’s fingerprint scanner.</p>
<p>The new scanner uses “ultrasonic sound technology” to look at a fingerprint in 3D instead of relying on a two-dimensional representation of the appendage’s bumps and ridges. This is supposed to make it harder for people to spoof someone else’s digit, and it might also make it easier to use the fingerprint sensor even with grimy, sweaty, and greasy fingertips.</p>
<p>Apple’s TouchID sensor is notorious for not working when a person’s fingers aren’t clean. Even a trace amount of sweat seems to throw the thing off, and it’s hard to know if it will work after meals, in the snow or rain, or in any other instance when a thumb might get a little wet. Fixing that problem would make any smartphone much less frustrating to use every day.</p>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of reasons not to secure a phone with a fingerprint. Police can force people to unlock their biometrically-secured devices without a warrant. Hackers can use publicly-available images and software to recreate someone’s fingerprints. Anyone who expects a fingerprint to keep them secure from dedicated intruders is asking for trouble.</p>
<p>Yet that’s no excuse for not making the best fingerprint scanner possible. Anyone who adopts a fingerprint scanner — and I’ll admit that I’m in this category — is making a conscious choice to give up some security in exchange for convenience. If that’s going to be the case, the least tech companies can do is make sure their scanners actually are convenient instead of being frustrating and unusable. Qualcomm, it seems, will now offer device manufacturers and consumers alike the best thing to come to fingerprint reading since inkless ink.</p>
