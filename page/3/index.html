          <p>Apple had a pretty good quarter.</p>
<p>And by “pretty good,” I mean it was the biggest quarter in history. And not just for Apple. For any company. Ever.</p>
<p>This page charts the past record holders. Until today, Russia’s Gazprom (the largest natural gas extractor in the world) held the record at $16.2 billion in a quarter.</p>
<p>Apple now holds the record: $18.04 billion in profit, fiscal Q1 of 2015.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Insane.</p>
<p>For reference, that means Apple makes around $8.3 million dollars per hour in profit (24 hours a day).</p>
<p>Of the current Top 20 record holding earners, 15 are Oil/Gas producers — primarily ExxonMobil and Shell. The other five are all Apple, over various quarters.</p>

          <p>As first reported late last night, Coinbase has launched the first regulated, US-based bitcoin exchange. The company crossed this milestone in part through a new partnership, and accompanying investment, from the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>In the hours since the WSJ first reported news of Coinbase’s latest bitcoin venture, the company has revealed additional details of how the exchange will operate and why, it believes, it offers “a better way to trade.”</p>
<p>We now know that the Coinbase exchange offers its customers insurance against “employee theft and hacking in an amount that exceeds the average value of online bitcoin it holds at any given time.” The company goes on to explain that this is the same A+-rated insurance that it has held on its wallet accounts since November 2013, and that the coverage is limited in the event that a user’s login credentials are compromised due to their own actions.</p>
<p>Coinbase also reiterates its significant security measures, including storing 97 percent of all customer funds offline, in so-called “cold storage,” using redundant, encrypted, and geographically distributed data storage. The company also requires two-factor authentication upon account login, and commits to undergoing regular IT security and financial audits. Where Coinbase differs from other exchanges making similar promises, is that the company has obtained relevant regulatory clearance to operate in 24 US states, including the finance and technology epicenters of New York and California. No other exchange company can claim the same.</p>
<p>But, despite the above protections, trading any security retains some risk. The company warns new users upon their first use of the exchange:</p>
<p>There is a risk of loss when you trade bitcoin. All trades are final. Please carefully consider whether trading bitcoin is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. Coinbase does not provide you with investment advice. [Bolding original]</p>
<p>Coinbase will charge a commission of 0.25 percent on all trades made on its exchange, however the company will offer a no-fee trading promotion through March 30 of this year.</p>
<p>The price of bitcoin has been in flux in recent weeks, falling to a 12-month low of $177 on January 9th, following a string of negative news events – including the BitStamp hack and the Silk Road trial – and subsequently rebounding to a high of $272 yesterday preceding to Coinbase exchange announcement, in part due to last week’s news of the Winklevoss twins’ planned Gemeni exchange and the Coinbase funding announcement. Prices shot up another 5 percent shortly after the WSJ report, reaching a high of $287 overnight, but have since settled again in the vicinity of $272.</p>
<p>With Coinbase now offering both its legacy wallet and brokerage service and its newly launched exchange, it’s possible to observe in market behavior on the two platforms. For example, while the price of purchasing a new bitcoin on the wallet platform at 7:55am PST was currently $273.08, the last trade on the exchange at the same time was $269.32. This spread is not altogether unexpected, and may represent a difference in the demographics and psychographics of the customers for each Coinbase platform, but it should not be overlooked as a window into the real-time psyche and shifts thereto of the market as a whole.</p>
<p>Coinbase Exchange is just a few hours old, but the company already has plans for expanding this platform across the remaining US states and eventually to serve the global market. Coinbase’s wallet platform currently operates in 18 countries and has set a goal of increasing that number to 30 by the end of 2015.</p>
<p>This big prize for Coinbase and its US exchange competitors like the forthcoming Gemeni and SecondMarket offerings is to see who can become the exchange of choice for the billions in institutional capital which has long been sitting on the sidelines waiting for an opportunity to enter this market. Some companies, like Gemeni, have aimed their offering squarely at attracting this capital, seemingly at the expense of winning retail traders. Coinbase has not gone to this extreme. It’s not yet clear whether the market will bifurcate itself into institutional and retail, or will follow the pattern of Wall Street where the major exchange serve both classes of demand.</p>
<p>As I said last night, “for those who view bitcoin as the ‘internet for money,’ and expect the technology to have a similarly transformative impact, [the arrival of a regulated domestic exchange marks] a big day indeed.” The animated “Lunar” rocket ship that was cruising across Coinbase’s website has reached its destination. Whether the company has delivered bitcoin to the promised land will become clearer in the coming months and years.</p>

          <p>(Editor’s note: This is a guest post by Boriz Wertz, founder of Version One Ventures. The post went through PandoDaily’s usual editorial process. Mr. Wertz was not paid for this post.)</p>
<p>Three roles that every investor should play What’s the right role for an investor to play with their portfolio? Should he or she be the biggest cheerleader, the toughest critic, or just have the deepest pockets?</p>
<p>As someone who is still relatively early in his investing career, I often think about what qualities set a successful investor relationship apart from the rest. Good investing and strong relationships don’t just happen. Like in a marriage, you have to work every day on making the relationship better and more productive for all involved.</p>
<p>Having sat on both sides of the table, I believe the real magic happens when you can carefully balance three pillars: supporting, challenging, and coaching.</p>
<p>Pillar one: the steadfast supporter</p>
<p>The moment the contracts are signed, the investor essentially joins the team and assumes the role of an early evangelist. There will be times when portfolio teams need an enthusiastic backer and a quick pep talk. Particularly when things get tough, it’s nice to know that someone will weather the storm and stick by you.</p>
<p>I remember trying to build my start-up during technology’s nuclear winter of 2001. Raising fresh money was nearly impossible, but our investor supported us throughout this tough period and didn’t take advantage of our situation. We financed the company at acceptable terms, even though the investor could have really turned the screws. Ultimately, we were able to sell our company to AbeBooks, which was later sold to Amazon.</p>
<p>Tough times bring out the true colors of an investor. Do they treat you fairly or take advantage of your vulnerable position?</p>
<p>Pillar two: the critic</p>
<p>Most entrepreneurs are inherently optimistic, so the last thing they need is someone who will be a cheerleader 100% of the time. Honest, sometimes harsh, feedback is necessary. Calling out a lack of financial discipline, lack of accountability, or poor product roadmap is never the popular thing to do, but this is when an investor often adds the most value.</p>
<p>I was reminded of the importance of this role a few months ago when a portfolio company of mine had just raised a large amount of money and started to scale the cost base much quicker than the revenue base. Within months the burn rate more than doubled to several thousands of dollars a month and as the company got distracted with aggressive hiring, the growth rate decelerated significantly. Since high burn and low growth are a lethal combination, this situation would have gotten critical had they continued down their path. Fortunately, the founders took my pushback well and right-sized the ship quickly.</p>
<p>Investors need to be comfortable in the role of devil’s advocate, asking the hard questions and challenging the assumptions. Founders need to understand that constant praise without honesty are just empty words. You need the investor’s perspective: they are looking out for you.</p>
<p>Pillar three: the coach</p>
<p>I’m a firm believer in learning from other people’s successes and mistakes. Individuals who have been through it before can offer great insight to entrepreneurs – such as how to attract top talent, build a strong board, expand into new sectors, etc.</p>
<p>I am always on the lookout for opportunities where my portfolio teams can improve, and often connect founders with a CEO coach. In addition, I share my own experiences scaling a company with portfolio CEOs and senior management teams. Getting an outside perspective from somebody with a deep understanding of the company or industry can be very eye opening – it often helps you learn what you didn’t know before, and build stronger problem solving skills.</p>
<p>As for founders, they should solicit advice from a wide variety of sources, but always filter any feedback through the prism of their own convictions. After all, it’s the CEO, and not the investor, who should have the final word.</p>
<p>Final thoughts</p>
<p>While cash is crucial to scaling a company or getting a product off the ground, an investor can provide much more value than the checkbook alone. Investors need to be comfortable being the cheerleader one day, and offering the dissenting voice the next. Likewise, entrepreneurs should be open to receiving all feedback, no matter the message. As with any significant relationship, this one requires true effort on both sides to work.</p>

          <p>According to Gawker, its offices along with at least two other New York media companies are under special protection of the New York Police Department, after all three outlets republished Charlie Hebdo covers depicting Muhammed.</p>
<p>On January 7, the Paris magazine Charlie Hebdo came under attack by gunmen who killed 12 people, presumably in response to controversial cartoons it published depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammed. Some Islamic teachings explicitly forbid pictorial representations of Muhammed. Furthermore, Charlie Hebdo’s illustrations often mocked Islam — along with every other religion on the planet.</p>
<p>An officer stationed outside Gawker told the outlet that the department was not acting on any specific threats made against media companies. Nor did the officer state whether the department had only offered protection to outlets that republished the Charlie Hebdo cartoons.</p>
<p>While the presence of New York cops isn’t always a friendly sight for all residents, it’s heartening to see the department devote resources to protecting a news outlet’s right to free speech. And nobody wants to see an organization of any kind fall victim to kind of horrific attack that befell Charlie Hebdo earlier this month.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time the NYPD ramped up security outside Gawker’s offices. In 2012, increased police protection was provided after then-staffer John Cook published a public document revealing the names of New Yorkers licensed to own a handgun. Nor was that the only time a connection was drawn between American gun enthusiasts and Islamic terrorists.</p>

          <p>In a sign indicating the ever-growing ties between Big Tech and Washington, Google gave $16.83 million to federal regulators and lawmakers last year, according to an analysis by Consumer Watchdog of records filed with the Clerk of the House. That’s up from the $14.06 million the company spent on lobbying in 2013, setting a new corporate record for the search giant.</p>
<p>Among tech companies, Google led the pack in lobbying expenditures, edging out Comcast which spent $16.80 million. Facebook, Apple, and Amazon also spent more than they ever on lobbying, lining the pockets of politicians and bureaucrats to the tune of $9.34 million, $4.74 million, and $4.11 million, respectively. These figures constituted double-digit increases over the previous year for all three firms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some major tech firms decreased lobbying expenditures from 2013, like Microsoft which spent $8.33 million — a 20 percent drop. Cisco, IBM, and Intel also cut back on lobbying in 2014.</p>
<p>So where does all this money go? Unfortunately, the filings themselves are fairly vague and merely list broad areas of lobbying interest, like “Regulation of online advertising” and “Privacy and data security issues.” But it’s not difficult to imagine where Google’s political interests lie, particularly as it and other tech firms battle companies like Comcast over net neutrality. And if these latest filings prove anything, it’s that Silicon Valley can now go toe-to-toe — at least when it comes to cash — with the more established lobbying strength of the telecommunications industry.</p>

          <p>Xiaomi’s combination of well-spec’ed phones and low price tags drove the company to over 60 million sales last year. That progress saw it replace Samsung as China’s top-selling smartphone company and become the world’s third top selling phone maker in the process.</p>
<p>The Chinese company’s flagship Mi devices typically retail for around $300 — its new Mi Note Pro notably breaks the $500 barrier for the first time — while its affordable Redmi family is sub-$150. For comparison, Apple’s top of the range iPhones sell for over $1,000 off contract, while the Samsung Note and GalaxyS families are similarly priced. So how can Xiaomi be so aggressive with its pricing?</p>
<p>Many theories have been put forward, including claims that Xiaomi sells at cost and makes money from other services. Hugo Barra, the company’s VP of International, lifted the lid on some of the company’s secret sauce in an interview with TechCrunch in Beijing last week.</p>
<p>Xiaomi is able to make price concessions thanks to the combination of a small portfolio and longer average selling time per device<br>Barra explained that Xiaomi is able to make price concessions thanks to the combination of a small portfolio and longer average selling time per device.</p>
<p>Importantly, Xiaomi continues to sell older devices (and tweaked versions of them) at reduced prices even after it releases newer models.</p>
<p>“A product that stays on the shelf for 18-24 months — which is most of our products — goes through three or four price cuts. The Mi2 and Mi2s are essentially the same device, for example,” Barra explained. “The Mi2/Mi2s were on sale for 26 months. The Redmi 1 was first launched in September 2013, and we just announced the Redmi 2 this month, that’s 16 months later.”</p>
<p>That’s important because the longer runway for devices gives Xiaomi leverage to secure better component deals with its suppliers.</p>
<p>“The reason we do these price cuts is because we’ve managed to negotiate component cost decreases [with our suppliers] over time, which ends up leaving us with a bigger margin than we’d like to have, so we do a price cut,” Barra added.</p>
<p>“The vast majority of the components [in our devices] are still the same, so in terms of supply chain and component sourcing, we’re on the same supply contracts as Redmi 1, which means we’re still getting the same discounts on components,” he explained. “We can continue to ride the cost curve, so the importance of having a very small portfolio is significant — the fact that we only launch a few products each year, and (the fact that) we only have two product families.”</p>
<p>xiaomi</p>
<p>Barra said that the dynamics are “very simple,” but a commitment to devices for two or three years isn’t just about making price cuts. He pointed out that Xiaomi maintains software updates, spare parts and other services that customers require, longer than most companies would.</p>
<p>“The more focused the portfolio, the more efficient we can be at managing those costs too,” he explained.</p>
<p>There are other factors that contribute to the cost structure, including Xiaomi’s lean, online-only marketing focus and its location close to manufacturing plants in China , but the management of components and supply chain partnerships is a crucial element.</p>
<p>Xiaomi has big plans for expanding beyond Asia this year, which will make its pricing model and supply chain more important than ever.</p>
<p>The company sells its phone using an online-only model in most markets, but it has recently begun testing operator partnerships outside of China. It is running a limited trial with Airtel in India, and has found partners in Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore.</p>
<p>Barra explained that operator partnerships are difficult in markets where the majority of consumers are on pre-paid tariffs — such as India — but it seems clear that Xiaomi is looking into ways to expand its retail footprint. It sold one million devices in its first five months in India using its flash sales model. If it can move beyond that and better meet demand for its phones in India and other emerging markets, it could vastly increase its sales figures in 2015.</p>
<p>Last year, Xiaomi projected that it would sell 100 million devices this year. It increased its target for 2014 mid-way through the year, but we’re yet to hear of a new figure for 2015 from the company.</p>

          <p>Xiaomi became the world’s third largest smartphone company based on sales last year, but it also invested in a number of companies in 2014. Its early deals have largely been in hardware, but today it announced[PDF] plans to put money into games and software by buying 2.98 percent of Kingsoft for HK$527 million (~$68 million).</p>
<p>Kingsoft started out developing PC games, but today the company — which is listed in Hong Kong and valued at over $2 billion — produces security, entertainment and enterprise products too. It already has strong links to Xiaomi, whose CEO and co-founder Lei Jun is also founder and chairman of Kingsoft.</p>
<p>The investment is notable because it is a sign of Xiaomi’s intention to increase its focus on software and services. Its deals to date have circled around hardware — including a $200 million investment in appliance maker Midea, and a funding round for wearables startup Misfit — but with the Kingsoft deal, Xiaomi may well be laying the ground for a dedicated games service, security features and other mobile services for its customers.</p>
<p>Xiaomi sold more than 60 million devices last year, a feat that saw it overtake Samsung as China’s top smartphone company and become the third biggest seller of smartphones worldwide in Q3 2014. With a burgeoning family of hardware and smart home products — including an air purifier, blood test device, smart TV and streaming box — Xiaomi could look to construct a network of services to further monetize its user base in the future.</p>
<p>Xiaomi hasn’t revealed its hand as yet, but Hugo Barra — the company’s VP of international — did tell TechCrunch last week that it is in the market for investments and acquisitions in India, with a particular focus on startups that offer mobile services and e-commerce.</p>
<p>The Xiaomi investment in Kingsoft is expected to be completed at the end of January. The company bought its shares from internet giant Tencent, which reduced its stake in Kingsoft to 9.6 percent. Lei Jun himself owns 15 percent of the company.</p>

          <p>On Wednesday, Microsoft will show off Windows 10, the next version of its decades-old operating system.</p>
<p>There’s a lot at stake. This may be Microsoft’s last chance to prove to the world that Windows still matters. </p>
<p>A decade ago more than 90% of devices on the internet ran Windows. With the rise of smartphones, and tablets running smartphone operating systems like iOS and Android, that number is down to 15 percent. Developers had to develop for Windows if they wanted to make money. Now, it’s one of many choices, and in mobile it’s an afterthought.</p>
<p>In fact, the rise of mobile devices has made the entire idea of an operating system seem a lot less relevant. People don’t buy an iPhone or iPad because it runs iOS, they buy it because it looks great in the store, feels great in their hands, is relatively easy to figure out, and runs the apps they need, which are easy to download and install.</p>
<p>Some people actively choose Android devices because they run Android, but Google gives hardware makers a lot of leeway to install their own software on top of Android, so the experience is a lot more varied than the Windows PC experience, where Microsoft always insisted on having Windows interface features front and center.</p>
<p>Big Misses In Mobile<br>Microsoft saw the mobile revolution happening and tried to capitalize on it with Windows Phone, its revamped operating system for smartphones, and Windows 8, which had a new interface that worked on touch screens as well as regular PCs.</p>
<p>Both initiatives have been disasters. Five years after its release, Windows Phone still has around 3 percent market share in new mobile phone shipments — less than its predecessor, Windows Mobile, had at its peak — and mobile developers consider it third, if they consider it at all.</p>
<p>Windows 8 was a confusing mess that alienated a lot of longtime Windows users and loyalists without helping Microsoft capture much of the rising tablet market.</p>
<p>PC sales went into free fall through most of 2013, and were down again in 2014. Around the time of the Windows 8 release then-CEO Steve Ballmer and other executives often threw out the figure of 400 million PCs shipped per year. In fact, the number in 2014 was just over 300 million.</p>
<p>You can’t blame this entirely on Windows 8 — the global economy has been weak for most of that time, and consumers have a lot more options. But Windows 8 certainly didn’t help.</p>
<p>So what can Microsoft do to make Windows relevant again? </p>
<p>What We Know About Windows 10 So Far<br>Microsoft has already shown off quite a few features and interface details about Windows 10, and we’ve seen a few leaks that give us some more information. Here’s what we know so far:</p>
<p>It will be more similar across devices. Microsoft has been promising for almost a year that the next version of Windows would be a lot more unified across PCs, tablets, and phones. Expect a single underlying core that developers can write to, and a single app store. That should mean that people who use one kind of Windows will have an easier time moving to another Windows device, and should increase the number of apps available on all three platforms. But that doesn’t mean it’ll be a single operating system — there will still be slightly different experiences depending on screen size and device type, and developers will still have to do custom work to get a PC app over to the phone, for instance.</p>
<p>Parts of it will look a lot more like traditional Windows. One criticism of Windows 8 was that it got rid of a bunch of familiar features and forced people to do things in new ways. Windows 10 will return the “Start Menu” — the little menu in the lower left hand corner, which has been the way you launch applications since Windows XP — and will reportedly bury or get rid of some confusing Windows 8 features like “Charms,” a set of icons that popped out from the right side of the screen but never made much intuitive sense. Here’s a picture of the Windows 10 start menu from a technical preview last fall:<br>windows 10 start menu<br>Microsoft</p>
<p>It will have a brand new browser. For the first time since Windows 95, Microsoft is apparently building a new browser. It’s code-named Spartan, and leaks suggest it will look and feel a lot more like Google’s Chrome, or like the mobile version of Apple’s Safari. It’ll have a reading mode (as did Internet Explorer 11, which runs on Windows 8.1), and may include a built-in version of Cortana, Microsoft’s answer to Apple’s Siri personal assistant. Internet Explorer will be there, but only for backward-compatibility. We hope to see Spartan next week.</p>
<p>It will adapt based on the kind of device you’re using. Another big complaint about Windows 8 was that it launched in a totally new “Modern” view with big square icons and new commands, like those Charms things. This mode was designed for tablets and touch screen computers, but wasn’t great for traditional PCs or laptops with keyboards and pointers. The old desktop was there, but you had to open it like an app, and switching between Modern and traditional was a pain. Windows 10 will have a new feature called Continuum that will automatically detect whether you’re using a keyboard or touch screen, and adapt what is shown on the screen accordingly.</p>
<p>Here’s a demo from last year:</p>
<p>It will probably come out in late 2015. Look for a fall release. We might hear more about that next week.</p>
<p>What We Don’t Know Yet<br>But there are a lot of important things about Windows 10 we don’t know yet, and that Microsoft will hopefully begin to reveal next week:</p>
<p>Will the way we buy it change? Microsoft made Windows 8.1 free for devices with a screen smaller than nine inches. There’s also a free version called Windows with Bing offered for free to some PC makers. But Microsoft could do a lot more interesting things here — for instance, there have been rumors a subscription-based version of Windows that has smaller, more regular feature updates.</p>
<p>Will there be new ways to do things between different Windows devices? If Windows 10 is supposed to present a more unified experience, what exactly will that look like? Will it be easier to start projects on one device then continue them on another? Also, Microsoft has been talking a lot about Windows and the Internet of Things — so will Windows 10 have some sort of new way to control or interact with a bunch of in-home or wearable devices?</p>
<p>Will we see a new version of Office? Microsoft has put out a touch-centric version of Office for Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android platform, but hasn’t shown one for Windows. It will probably release one around the same time as Windows 10, and we could see the first demonstrations of it next week.</p>
<p>Will the Surface continue? Microsoft’s foray into PC hardware has been expensive — it had to write down $900 million in unsold inventory in its first year, and some estimates put the price tag at around $1.7 billion as of last August. It was designed to show the world that a tablet-PC combination was interesting and desirable, and that Windows 8 enabled it. But now, PC makers have followed on with their own hybrids, and while none of them have taken the world by storm, it’s not clear why Microsoft needs to keep pushing its own version — and alienating PC makers like HP, who are striking back by releasing more non-Windows devices like Chromebooks.</p>
<p>What’s happening to Windows on ARM? This was a big question for analyst Michael Cherry at Directions on Microsoft (disclosure: I worked there from 2000 through 2010). ARM processors are the low-powered chips that run most smartphones and tablets, including the iPad. Windows 8 had a version for ARM tablets, but nobody’s shipping a new ARM-based Windows tablet today — even Microsoft updated only the Intel-based Surface Pro, not the ARM-based Surface RT, last year. One possibility: Microsoft will only support ARM on its Windows 10 phone operating system, and will let larger versions of those phones cover the “phablet” or mini-tablet range. </p>
<p>What’s the big new feature we just NEED? This is the hardest question of all. The Windows PC used to be the center of our digital lives — it was how we got online, how we played games, how we communicated with people, and how we got work done. Those roles have been taken by other devices now, particularly smartphones, but also tablets. So what will Windows 10 introduce that makes Windows essential again? </p>
<p>We’ll be covering Microsoft’s Windows 10 introduction from its Redmond, Wash., headquarters next Wednesday, January starting around 11:30 a.m. ET. Tune in for news throughout the week.</p>

          <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Thursday he would offer a proposal in his State of the Union speech that would make two years of community college free for anyone willing to work for it.</p>
<p>Obama said in a video message released by the White House that in a visit to Tennessee on Friday he would announce the program to make community college accessible for everyone.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, students who attend at least half-time, maintain a 2.5 GPA while in college, and make steady progress toward completing their programs would have their tuition eliminated.</p>
<p>The White House said the program would be taken in partnership with states and was inspired by new programs in Tennessee and Chicago. If all states participate, an estimated 9 million students could benefit. A full-time community college student could save an average of $3,800 in tuition a year. </p>

          <p>There’s an illustration being shared on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter that claims to be a tribute created by street artist Banksy in response to the terrorist attack that killed 12 people near the offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris earlier today.</p>
<p>While the image does have a touching message, it’s almost certainly a fake - not created by Banksy.</p>
<p>Here’s the illustration that everyone is sharing:</p>
<p>Fake Banksy illustration<br>Instagram/Banksy</p>
<p>Mashable is reporting that the image was posted by a “popular ‘Banksy’ account” on Instagram. The instagram.com/banksy Instagram isn’t run by Banksy at all, and is actually a fan page that shares street art created by a variety of different artists - rarely with any attribution.</p>
<p>Search on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and you’ll see plenty of popular accounts that seem to be official Banksy pages. The problem of fake social media accounts is so widespread that Banksy has even posted on his official website to deny he runs any Facebook or Twitter accounts. He does, however, have one Instagram account, which was used during his recent trip to New York.</p>
<p>Facebook was recently forced to remove the verification checkmark for a Facebook page for a Banksy account with millions of Likes after the artists PR representative denied that he had anything to do with it.</p>
<p>The Instagram account that the pencil illustration originates from is part of a ring of fake social media profiles. As well as the fake Instagram and Facebook accounts, the administrators behind the Banksy pages also run a YouTube account that re-uploads popular viral videos to capitalize on their popularity.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a video posted by the fake Banksy YouTube account:</p>
<p>Another clue that points to the image being fake is its file size. The image uploaded to the fake Banksy social media posts is pixelated and low-resolution. Banksy is an artist who makes a living from exhibiting his work, he wouldn’t want his work to be displayed in a way that makes it look bad.</p>
<p>It’s tricky to verify new Banksy work. Because of Banksy’s continued anonymity, and the often confusing similarity to other graffiti artists, many works of art end up mistakenly labeled as created by Banksy. A handful of galleries and companies in the UK are, however, experts in his work, meaning that they can verify prints purported to originate from Banksy.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, given today’s tragic events, the sentiment is strong.</p>
