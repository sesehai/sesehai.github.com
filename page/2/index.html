          <p>Last week, Pinterest made a huge change to how startup employees collect equity, Fortune’s Dan Primack reports.</p>
<p>Now, the digital pinboard company will let former employees who have been at the company at least two years retain their vested stock options for an additional seven years without exercising them.</p>
<p>This is unprecedented for startups and could be a huge boon to startup employees if other big private companies follow suit. </p>
<p>Here’s why:</p>
<p>Typically, startup employees give up higher salaries in favor of taking stock options.</p>
<p>The hope here is that when the startup they work for gets super successful, those stock options will be worth more than their lost salary and the employees will cash in on their company’s success as it grows.</p>
<p>But there’s a catch: If an employee leaves the company, the company usually gives them 90 days to exercise those options. That means the employee has to buy the options at the “strike price” — the stock price at the time when the options were granted.</p>
<p>The employee may also have to pay taxes on the value of the exercised options. (This gets confusing, as there are different kinds of options, and some of those taxes can sometimes be refunded in later years — read up on the Alternative Minimum Tax and incentive stock options if you’re interested in the details.)</p>
<p>If the company is public this isn’t a huge problem. The employee can just sell some newly exercised shares at the market price — which is presumably higher than the strike price (or the shares aren’t worth exercising) — then take that money and use it to buy the rest of the shares and pay taxes.</p>
<p>So, for instance, if the employee is granted 10,000 shares, they might be able to sell 1,000 to pay for exercising those shares and 500 for the tax bill, and still end up with a nice 8,500 shares.</p>
<p>But what if the company’s still private, as is increasingly the case with the hottest tech companies?</p>
<p>Then, unless the company is willing to buy back those shares, or willing to let the employee sell them on the secondary market, the employee has to pay cash, up front, to exercise those shares. Then, the employee has to pay more to the IRS.</p>
<p>Usually, companies give employees a short window to exercise — something like 60 or 90 days. If you’re too cash-strapped to buy those shares and pay taxes during that window, too bad. No stock for you, no matter how long you were at the company and many options you were granted. </p>
<p>this area has good ambience for either an after work drink or a mid day work sprintBusiness Insider / Jillian D’Onfro<br>Pinterest offices</p>
<p>Pinterest is giving employees a much longer time — 7 years — to come up with the money to buy unexercised options.</p>
<p>That effectively makes those options a lot more valuable as compensation, as nearly every employee will be able to exercise them — especially if the company goes public during that time, and employees can sell some shares to cover the cost of exercising them.</p>
<p>If other companies follow suit, this could change the entire landscape for startups, making it easier for them to attract and retain employees.</p>
<p>Just last week, Pinterest raised an additional $367 million at a at an $11 billion valuation. In total, Pinterest has raised $1.1 billion.</p>

          <p>Something fascinating happened Wednesday.</p>
<p>The people who set monetary policy said something without explicitly saying it.</p>
<p>Bear with us.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement leaned dovish, meaning we can expect monetary policy to remain loose and stimulative for a little while longer.</p>
<p>This was kind of surprising as most economists were expecting the Fed to stop using the phrase “remain patient” in talking about normalizing monetary policy (hiking interest rates).</p>
<p>In the statement, the FOMC did indeed take out the language “remain patient.”</p>
<p>However, the meaning of the existing language didn’t change that much, according to a note from Jefferies’ Ward McCarthy, so it’s unlikely that interest rates will rise in the next couple of meetings.</p>
<p>“The word “patient” was removed, but the meaning of patient remained. Translation: this is a small step toward normalization, and liftoff is not on the immediate horizon,” wrote McCarthy.</p>
<p>This willingness to not rush rate hikes was reinforced by reductions in the Fed’s forecasts for GDP growth and inflation.</p>
<p>Because of all of this, McCarthy doesn’t think an initial rate hike is going to happen as early as June.</p>
<p>Here’s what the new FOMC language says: </p>
<p>To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress–both realized and expected–toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said more or less the same think that McCarthy did (with the exception of a firm rate hike prediction) at the press conference following the FOMC statement.</p>
<p>“Just because we removed the word ‘patient’ doesn’t mean we’re going to be impatient,” she said.</p>

          <p>Apple is reportedly working on a plan to launch its own TV service.</p>
<p>A Wall Street Journal report suggests Apple, which already lets users watch television and Netflix shows through its Apple TV device, is working with programmers “to offer a slimmed-down bundle of TV networks this fall.”</p>
<p>The Journal cites sources familiar with the talks who say Apple’s subscription service may provide “about 25 channels, anchored by broadcasters such as ABC, CBS and Fox, and would be available on Apple devices such as the Apple TV.”</p>
<p>The as-yet-unannounced service would cost $30 to $40 dollars per month, according to WSJ.</p>
<p>Various rumors and speculation about Apple’s intention to disrupt television have been circulating for a while, but the tech company’s plans have so far been vague, and somewhat noncommittal.</p>
<p>There has been talk in recent years that Apple might develop its own television hardware, and when that simmered down, the conversation returned to the possibility that Apple might offer precisely the type of streaming service that’s apparently being negotiated now.</p>
<p>What is clear, however is that Apple wants to cater to customers who are giving up on expensive traditional cable subscriptions. That industry has been ripe for disruption for some time now, especially as other platforms like Netflix and Amazon build ever-stronger programming that is finally nipping at the heels of legacy media.</p>
<p>The Journal notes that NBCUniversal is not included in the talks at the moment, “because of a falling-out between Apple and NBCUniversal parent company Comcast.”</p>

          <p>The past six months haven’t been kind of some of the earliest tech blogs. Last November, ReadWrite was sold off by SAY Media who threw in the towel on its content properties. Now, multiple staffers have confirmed on Twitter that Gigaom will shut down.</p>
<p>Why? According to senior writer Mathew Ingram, it simply ran out of cash.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2006 by former Forbes journalist Om Malik to cover technology with a focus on startups. Since then, the company has raised $22.3 million in venture capital. Its most recent round came in February of 2014, raising an $8 million Series F in February of 2014 from True Ventures, Alloy Ventures, Shea Ventures, and Reed Elsevier Ventures. That same month, Malik stepped away from journalism to become a full-time partner at True Ventures.</p>
<p>To its credit, Gigaom’s reporting and analysis often went beyond the press release, particularly in its excellent coverage of the cleantech industry. But I stopped reading Gigaom last October when it published a piece of sponsored content bought and paid for by the National Security Agency. (That page is still live, but the story appears to be missing). It was a fairly innocuous post; essentially a job listing. But the fact that a journalistic organization — particularly one that covers technology — would choose arguably the most anti-journalist organization on the planet as a publishing partner, was not only a massive conflict of interest. It was also a slap in the face of any journalist who was ever targeted for surveillance or smearing by the US defense apparatus.</p>
<p>“It violated everything that you should be thinking about as a publisher,” Sam Slaughter, VP of Content at the native advertising firm Contently, told me. “In terms of what you put in front of your readers, what you cover, whether your readership should trust you, all of these things. My jaw hit the floor.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Gigaom, cashing checks from the NSA just wasn’t enough to save it.</p>
<p>When ReadWrite was sold last November, the Awl’s Choire Sicha tweeted, “THIS IS WHEN THE GREAT CONTENT SHAKEOUT BEGAN, REMEMBER THIS DAY.” At the time, I was skeptical that the ReadWrite news was a harbinger of things to come. But after today’s news? Hot venture funded tech companies, you are on watch.</p>

          <p>Most of the things revealed at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona aren’t worth getting too excited about. For example, how many people are really going to be using any of the payment platforms introduced during the conference, or buying the expensive-but-“secure” devices, or paying even the slightest attention to talk about Google’s wireless network or Facebook’s drones?</p>
<p>But there is at least one thing worth paying attention to: Qualcomm’s fingerprint scanner.</p>
<p>The new scanner uses “ultrasonic sound technology” to look at a fingerprint in 3D instead of relying on a two-dimensional representation of the appendage’s bumps and ridges. This is supposed to make it harder for people to spoof someone else’s digit, and it might also make it easier to use the fingerprint sensor even with grimy, sweaty, and greasy fingertips.</p>
<p>Apple’s TouchID sensor is notorious for not working when a person’s fingers aren’t clean. Even a trace amount of sweat seems to throw the thing off, and it’s hard to know if it will work after meals, in the snow or rain, or in any other instance when a thumb might get a little wet. Fixing that problem would make any smartphone much less frustrating to use every day.</p>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of reasons not to secure a phone with a fingerprint. Police can force people to unlock their biometrically-secured devices without a warrant. Hackers can use publicly-available images and software to recreate someone’s fingerprints. Anyone who expects a fingerprint to keep them secure from dedicated intruders is asking for trouble.</p>
<p>Yet that’s no excuse for not making the best fingerprint scanner possible. Anyone who adopts a fingerprint scanner — and I’ll admit that I’m in this category — is making a conscious choice to give up some security in exchange for convenience. If that’s going to be the case, the least tech companies can do is make sure their scanners actually are convenient instead of being frustrating and unusable. Qualcomm, it seems, will now offer device manufacturers and consumers alike the best thing to come to fingerprint reading since inkless ink.</p>

          <p>When it comes to productivity applications, groups change everything. Tasks that are easy or merely annoying when two people are involved become a nightmare when the number of participants expands. This has led to hundreds of million or billion dollar valuations for companies that address the problem around messaging and collaboration. Los Angeles-based Klutch is aiming to bring the same kind of solution to scheduling.</p>
<p>Klutch has made a few key insights into the group scheduling process that it hopes will make the experience easier and more efficient for all involved. First, the app includes a full-featured messaging client aimed at avoiding the asynchronous back and forth of email and enabling plans to be developed in more real-time. Next, the app integrates with each user’s calendar to simplify determining shared availability. And lastly, the app integrates with discovery platforms to help recommend locations for meetings while also supporting virtual meetings via third-party audio and video conference calls.</p>
<p>“The big learning from [my previous company] Atlas to Klutch is the fact that all scheduling happens from natural conversation flow,” says Klutch founder and CEO Hunter Gray. “So we’ve given people the ability to have a WhatsApp plus Yelp plus iCal experience that starts from natural group chat.”</p>
<p>Plenty of companies have attempted to solve group scheduling before – think Boomerang Calendar – but none that I’ve encountered have combined the above functionality. In the future, Klutch’s plan is to incorporate AI to help make smarter recommendations based on contextual clues collected from group chat conversations and calendar data.</p>
<p>“We collect really powerful intent data because we’re capturing groups in the middle of organizing something during the ‘inner circle’ conversations where decisions are being made, not have been made,” Gray says. “So we can eventually give highly contextual suggestions and discounts based upon a group’s dynamics and intent, [which falls into] four levels: location, time and date, who’s involved, and the context.”</p>
<p>Klutch 2.0, the company’s first feature-complete version, has been available on iOS for approximately five months. Today the company is launching complementary Android and Web versions, rounding out its availability and addressing what has been the largest complaints of existing users. Klutch remains a mobile-first product, but with today’s update, it’s now possible for non-users to participate in scheduling chats and receive event invites via a temporary Web-link shared via email.</p>
<p>Klutch is in the very early days, with just 25,000 downloads and 10 percent of these users engaging with the app actively each month. The company has yet to spend on user acquisition, but has benefitted from being featured prominently in the iOS App Store’s Best New Apps section. Gray hopes that the platform expansion will help grow both adoption and engagement. Already, 60 percent of iOS users who are invited to Klutch have downloaded the app. With Android now available that viral loop should be a bit more effective as existing and new users create new groups.</p>
<p>One thing Klutch has going for it is the makeup of its founding team. In addition to his prior experience with Atlas, which itself was a group scheduling and productivity tool, Gray was previously a top-producing team leader within the direct sales industry, meaning he managed large groups of sales professionals. For Klutch, he recruited Lisa Dusseault, the co-author of the ubiquitous CalDAV protocol (among others), to be his co-founder. Collectively they know as much about both the needs of busy professionals and the technology available to address them as any team in the space. Together, Gray and Dusseault have raised $1.5 million for Klutch from investors including Knight &amp; Bishop, 37 Ventures, ACE Fund, and Launchpad LA.</p>
<p>“We’ve looked at the explosion of the messaging space and watched all these companies grow to billions of dollars in valuation,” Gray says. “It’s still shocking to me that no one’s created a product with that level of success in the calendaring and scheduling space. We want to be the productivity messenger.”</p>
<p>Gray is right that there are no calendaring unicorn. Some, like Sunrise, Tempo, and Fantastical, have earned critical acclaim and attracted meaningful VC investment. But none have truly broken out to the level that Whatsapp, Line, Yammer, Slack, and others have done in the messaging and collaboration space.</p>
<p>Most of the innovation in calendaring to date has focused on inward productivity, adding things like intelligent assistants and map and phone integration to make the individual user’s life easier. Klutch is focused on solving those issues that arise when calendaring is focused outward.</p>
<p>The downside for this new product is that group scheduling, while painful, is not an everyday problem. And for general-purpose calendaring, many of the above competitors offer more functionality and have largers active user bases. If Klutch is hoping to be its users’ everyday calendar app, it will need to be as good for these individual use-cases as it is when groups are concerned. In that regard, it has some work remaining. Gray and Dussealult seem to relish the challenge.</p>
<p>“With our platform expansion, there no longer a limitation on where and how our users and their friends, family, and co-workers can access Klutch,” Gray says. “The name Klutch comes from how we want people to feel when they use the product,” Gray says. “It’s like Tom Brady scoring on the final play to win a game. It’s a similar feeling when you finally get six people to agree to a place and time to meet.”</p>

          <p>Twitter is testing a new feature that creates an “instant timeline” for new users based on what those users’ friends (as collected from a smartphone’s contacts list) are already tweeting about.</p>
<p>The feature addresses a common complaint about Twitter: that it’s hard to know who to follow, which makes it harder for new users to suss out why they should even bother to use the service.</p>
<p>Now, instead of having to fumble about in search of accounts worth following, new users will get a better idea of why Twitter thinks it should join their list of must-visit social networks. A problem with which the embattled service has struggled for years might finally be solved.</p>
<p>The New York Times’ Vindu Goel said the feature managed to guess his interests fairly well, but he did complain that Twitter thought he might want to see tweets about sports, or from brands. (I was unable to test the new feature from myself when I tried to create a new account earlier.)</p>
<p>To which I would respond that Goel is basically complaining that the new “instant timelines” provide too accurate a view into what using Twitter will be like after the initial charm fades.</p>
<p>That’s when the sports tweets seem to dominate the service whenever there’s some kind of game, match, or other event; when the brands start to infiltrate users’ timeline with off-beat messages or promoted missives; and when the only thing anyone talks about is the media.</p>
<p>New users should know that going into the service. Half the time they’re going to watch as the media snarks out about the latest headlines. Another quarter of the time they’re going to see groan-worthy tweets from brands that should know better. The other quarter mixes the two.</p>
<p>People should know about this hell before Twitter manages to work its way into the lulls in a conversation, the lines at a grocery store, or the linoleum tiling of a bathroom floor. In that way it seems these new “instant timelines” are an honest feature.</p>
<p>Whether that’s going to be good for Twitter, which would probably prefer for its service to become something other than a vortex of “ironic” condescension and vitriol, is another story.</p>

          <p>Google has taken another step towards knowing everything about its users.</p>
<p>The company announced today that Google Now, the virtual assistant software that promises to provide information before a consumer even knows she needs it, will now be able to collect and present relevant data from some 40 third-party applications.</p>
<p>Here’s one example, from the blog post announcing the platform’s expansion, of how this ability to showcase information from other apps might work for consumers:</p>
<p>In the morning, catch up on news of the day with cards from The Guardian. On your commute, Pandora can give you recommendations for music to play, based on what you like, or you can be reminded to complete your daily French lesson on Duolingo. During your downtime, you can take care of the groceries, with a card from Instacart reminding you to stock up on the things you often order. If you’re planning a trip and looked up places to stay on your Airbnb app but couldn’t make up your mind, you’ll see Now cards from Airbnb for the location and dates you’ve researched. And when you land at an airport, you’ll see a card to order a Lyft.</p>
<p>This is supposed to be an exciting peek into a world where Google Now can know everything about you and make your life easier by unifying scores of applications in a virtual assistant that happens to have been made by a multi-tens-of-billion-dollar business built on selling consumers’ personal information to advertisers.</p>
<p>But the “new and improved” Google Now seems more like a nightmare scenario that makes it even harder to keep Google from learning all about its customers. It would know when they have woken up, when they’re driving, and when their flights land. It would know where they eat, what language they’re studying, and what music they like.</p>
<p>There’s a fair chance the company already knows much of this information. (How else are you going to find a language-learning app than by searching for it in Google? Or book a flight whose receipts are sent to Gmail? Or explore a city with anything besides Google Maps?) Yet this latest update is much more upfront about this fact, leaving no doubt about just how deeply into your life Google wishes to peer.</p>
<p>Google knows almost everything already, but it’s not satisfied with “almost.” For all the things it doesn’t know, it seems the plan is to partner with other companies to gather this information.  And, by saving consumers a few taps whenever they want to use their phones, Google will likely convince consumers it’s a trade-off worth making. After all, the main reason Google has survived (and thrived) this long is because it can make convenience trump privacy.</p>
<p>Now, if you’ll excuse me, Google Chrome just told me I’ve written too many words about how Google might be eroding consumer privacy. Luckily it’s playing this YouTube video to calm me down while it finds the weather forecast for the dank, dark dungeon Eric Schmidt built when he was still the company’s chief executive.</p>

          <p>Amazon has a new product called WorkMail debuting today (via Forbes), which is an email and calendaring service that aims to provide those tools for corporate customers. The tech is based on Amazon Web Services, and aims to best the reigning champs (which include Microsoft, and to a lesser extent, Google) in terms of ease of use and security.</p>
<p>The WorkMail product is compatible with existing client software like Outlook, and as such it could be easier to substitute for legacy Exchange email service offerings in place at many big corporate institutions provided by Microsoft. WorkMail is also encrypted once they’re sent, according to the Wall Street Journal, and then decrypted via a company-controlled key at the other end of the tunnel when received by the intended target. Emails are stored on Amazon servers located in geographic areas designed by its clients, marking another security feature that may be especially appealing to European customers post-NSA revelations.</p>
<p>Amazon’s pricing for WorkMail works out to about $4 per inbox, which is in line with the competition, but so far it doesn’t look like Amazon is offering up any additional features like access to the kinds of office document production software suites that Google and Microsoft offer.</p>
<p>AWS branching out to business that focuses more on the end-user and less on providing back-end solutions is interesting, but Amazon still seems to be positioning this as primarily a layer once removed from the person doing the actual email; it’s something to swap out for Exchange, leaving the interface software (Outlook on the desktop, or native mail clients on mobile) intact. WorkMail also offers a “feature-rich” web-based client for access without any special software.</p>
<p>Amazon intends to launch this in Q2 of 2015 at this point, and will also offer deals that incorporate its recently launched WorkDocs (formerly Zocalo) AWS-powered cloud-based enterprise storage. The $4 plan comes with a 50GB inbox limit, while just $2 extra per user per month will add a 200GB Zocalo file storage block on top of that. A preview is available now for those wanting to sign up for an early look.</p>
<p>The ambitions of AWS clearly go beyond the cloud computing back-end, and Amazon might view WorkMail as a way to gain more general recognition for its services line of business.</p>

          <p>The Apple Watch will start shipping in April to consumers, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook, who revealed that month as the expected target launch date for the company on Apple’s Q1 2015 earnings call. The timeframe for launch was described as “early 2015″ when the Apple Watch was originally announced in September of last year.</p>
<p>The Apple Watch release date has been the subject of much speculation since its announcement, with recent reports pegging March as the month of its arrival. Cook’s decision to add some clarity to its actual release timeline is uncharacteristic for Apple, which normally doesn’t put a firm launch date on unreleased products, but pre-announcing the hardware months in advance was already a departure from standard practice.</p>
<p>Setting a more definite timeline for the Apple Watch does set expectations, however, ensuring that no one will be surprised when the wearable doesn’t appear in March as rumored. It also helps developers time their software releases correctly. Developers wanting to target the platform have so far depended upon using a virtual simulation of the wearable, and haven’t had any set deadline to work towards, so an announced April shipping target provides a clear goal to aim for.</p>
<p>Apple’s decision to pre-announce the Apple Watch was designed in part to get developers on board with the platform, so this helps set expectations in that regard. Its typical secrecy around product launches also isn’t necessary in this case, given that the Watch was pre-announced last year and expectations were already set for a general window.</p>
<p>“I’m using it every day, and love it, and I can’t live without it,” Cook said on the call, explaining his own excitement for the product. He also defended the April timeframe as within Apple’s defined “early 2014″ range in response to an analyst question which implied Apple may have wanted to deliver it earlier.</p>
